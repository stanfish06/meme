            <li>configure:
              <ul>
                <li>Clarified the proper use of the <code>--with-mpidir</code>
	          option in the <code>install.html</code> manual. 
                  <code>configure</code> expects the MPI compiler etc. to be in a subdirectory named '<code>/bin</code>'

        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>Fixed bug in BED input to MEME Suite servers that caused
		valid BED files to be rejected.  This bug caused
		the default version of databases to always be used for verification
		of BED file input.</li>
	    <li>MEME-ChIP: Fixed description of the default behavior of the <code>-neg</code> option.
		It now says that control sequences will preserve statistics of the order
		specified by the <code>-order</code> option.</li>

* [August 5, 2024] Release 5.5.6 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>MEME:
              <ul> 
                <li>In MEME HTML output, fetch alternate javascript needed for downloading PDF or SVG 
                images of the motif location block diagrams if the MEME Suite webserver is not accessible.</li>
		<li>In MEME HTML output, download the PDF and SVG javascript from the MEME Suite webserver
		in asynchronous mode so that the HTML will display quickly even if the webserver is down.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>MoMO:
              <ul> 
	        <li>Peptide modification values may now be free text, not just weights.</li>
	        <li>Added test of PTM file containing text in peptide modifications.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>MAST:
              <ul> 
                <li>Added the warning message that a motif is being skipped if its log-odds matrix
		cannot be scaled (e.g, is all zeros).</li>
	        <li>Improved the error message if all motifs are skipped.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>T-Gene:
              <ul> 
		<li>Allow BED files of Loci to start at position 0.</li>
		<li>Ignore "track" and "browser" lines.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>bed2fasta:
              <ul> 
		<li>Ignore "track" and "browser" lines and empty or all-space lines.</li>
		<li>Warn and skip lines with fewer than 3 fields.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>All webservers:
	      <ul>
		<li>On <code>submit</code>, the job queue is checked and
		the form is only submitted if the job queue is OPEN.</li>
		<li>The job queue is set to OPEN if there are <code>min_pending</code>
		or fewer jobs waiting to run.  It is set to closed if there are <code>max_pending</code>
		or more waiting jobs.  Otherwise, the job queue status is not changed.
		Thus, there is hysteresis in the OPEN/CLOSED state. The values of <code>min_pending</code>
		and <code>max_pending</code> are 250 and 500, respectively, and are set by the 
		<code>job-queue.sh</code> script. This script runs on the production server once per
		minute to update the queue status.</li>
		<li>The job queue state does not affect Tomtom jobs submitted if the <code>Run immediately</code>
		box is checked.</li>
                <li>Side-bar Menu: The menu now shows the status of the job queue (OPEN or CLOSED) as well as the
		number of jobs running and waiting. When the Queue Status  menu is clicked, cacheing is now 
                prevented when fetching the queue information from the server for the "Jobs Running:" 
		and "Jobs waiting to run:" fields so that they will correctly reflect the current state.</li> 
	        <li>All input files are now checked for size and file name length immediately
		upon entry.  This includes custom alphabet files, sequence files, BED files, loci files, 
		background files, and motif files.  File name lengths are limited to 100 characters.
		Motif names are limited to 100 characters.</li>
		<li>Improved the error messages when parsing custom alphabet files.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>Submitting a motif from MEME and STREME HTML files.
	      <ul>
		 <li>The destination web servers (Tomtom, FIMO, MAST, GOMo, SpaMo) now
		   show the name of the source file of the motif (e.g., <code>my_meme.html</code>)
		   and the motif number.</li>
	      <li>The submitted motif is stored in a file with a descriptive name and with
		  <code>.txt</code> appended.</li>
	      <li>The maximum name length of the source file of the motif is 100 characters.</li>
	      <li>The maximum length of the of the motif is 100 characters.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Documentation</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>MoMO:
              <ul> 
                <li>Fixed bug when a column name contains tabs in the PTM file, and
    		documented that this is not allowed.</li>
    		<li>Fix Handling of <code>\r</code> in DOS formatted files.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>SpaMo: 
	      <ul>
		<li>Documented the special characters in motif names
    		that get replaced with underscores when forming
    		the TSV file names for the output of <code>-dumpseqs</code> and 
		<code>-dumpsigs</code>.</li>
		<li>The terminolgy in the USAGE message has been clarified
		by renaming command-line input <code>primary motif</code> to <code>primary motif db</code> 
		and <code>secondary motifs</code> to <code>secondary motif db</code>.</li>
              </ul>
	    </li>
            <li>Tomtom:
	      <ul>
		<li>Clarified how <code>-min-overlap</code> behaves if either the
		query or target motif is shorter than the minimum: the shorter motif's
		width is used in place of the user-specified minimum for that query.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
            <li>bed-format.html:
	      <ul>
		<li>Clarified that BED files for MEME Suite must be tab-delimited and 
		"track" and "browser" lines are ignored.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>BED and FASTA File input to MEME Suite servers:
              <ul> 
		<li>Fixed crashing caused by BED files resulting in FASTA
		files that were too large for the server.
		Added checking of expanded BED file size to webservers
    		to prevent very large resulting FASTA files.  Total
    		form size (including expanded BED file) is still the
    		same: <code>80MB = 1024 * 1024 * 80</code> bytes.</li>
                <li>Fixed bug causing BED files not to be remembered
    		after hitting the browser "back" button.</li>
	        <li>Allow header lines allowed in BED files (lines starting with "#", "track" or "browser").</li>
		<li>Allow BED coordinates to start at 0.
		<li>Persist category, genome, version and name of selected FASTA databases
		and BED files in browser after REFRESH, BACK and FORWARD buttons are clicked.</li>
		<li>Fix bug with BED files with <code>Other Genomes</code>.  This required enforcing DNA-only for 
		  BED files in web servers in ComponentSequences.java.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>MEME:
              <ul> 
                <li>Fixed bug when the input sequences contain nothing but "N" or "X" 
		characters.  The motif letter frequencies were being set to 0.  Now they
		are set to <code>1/alen</code>, where <code>alen</code> is the length of the alphabet.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>MoMO:
              <ul> 
                <li>Fixed bug when a column name contains tabs in the PTM file, and
    		documented that this is not allowed.</li>
    		<li>Fix Handling of <code>\r</code> in DOS formatted files.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>SpaMo:
              <ul> 
                <li>Fixed bug when motif names contain special characters
		that caused SpaMo to crash when the <code>-dumpseqs</code> or <code>-dumpsigs</code>
		option was specified.  The following characters are now replaced
		with undersores in the TSV output file names:
		            ASCII 0 to 31, and
    		and any charcters in the list: <code>()<>/\|?*:</code>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>STREME:
              <ul> 
                <li>Fixed bug when the input sequences contain nothing but "N" or "X" 
		characters.  The sequence_db frequencies in the XML file were being set to -NAN.  Now they
		are set to <code>1/alen</code>, where <code>alen</code> is the length of the alphabet.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>Tomtom:
              <ul> 
		<li>Fixed coding oversight thereby reducing memory usage by 50% when using <code>-incomplete-scores</code>
		option.
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>T-Gene:
              <ul> 
		<li>Fixed bug that caused inaccurate calculation of correlation <i>p</i>-values and <i>q</i>-values.
		Correlation <i>p</i>-values are now computed correctly (as described in the
		original T-Gene paper) by permuting the order the tissue-specific histone values for each locus.
		For up to five tissues, the (null) correlation with the expression value at the TSS
		is computed for each of the unique "derangements" (permutations with no "fixed points") of the tissues.
		For six or more tissues, 256 null correlation values are computed using 256 derangments.
		All null correlation values for all links for a given histone are combined to provide the null
		distribution for correlations for that histone. </li>
                <li>Fixed bug that caused crashing when the number of
		loci in the BED file was small.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>update-sequence-db:
              <ul>
		<li>Fixed progelem with <code>--misc</code> option that caused DNA and Protein versions
		of the same database no show up separately in MEME Suite menus.  The fix involved changing the
		<code>edition</code> from the timestamp on the file to the current date.  Files
		updated on the same day will now have the same <code>edition</code> and so will be
		shown together in the MEME Suite menus even if they have different timestamps.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
	    <li>Other:
              <ul>
	        <li>Removed built files from website.mk.  They were not being built previously
		due to the built versions being present with more recent dates.</li>
		<li>Added "ps" command to Docker container.</li>
		<li>Fixed clearing of errors in Custom alphabet field when radio button is changed.</li>
		<li>Removed tissue/cell-specific checkbox from Sequence Databases page because it is not
		currently used.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>

* [December 7, 2023] Release 5.5.5 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
            <li>SEA:
              <ul>
                <li>SEA now creates a single file (<code>sites.tsv</code>) in TSV format that contains
                    the positions of the sites in the positive (primary) sequences
                    of each motif found to be significant by SEA.  This file is NOT output
		    if you specify the <code>--noseqs</code> option.</li>
	        <li>Added the <code>--no-pgc</code> option. FASTA sequence headers are <b>always</b> 
		  parsed for genomic coordinates unless the <code>--no-pgc</code> option is specified.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>STREME: 
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed how matching sites are sorted for output to make consistent across computer types.</li>
                <li>Added links to matching sequences and matching sites files to web server status results page.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>XSTREME and MEME-ChIP output: added space before help bubbles for expand-cluster 
		and CentriMo Group links for clarity.</li>
	    <li>CentriMo, STREME, SEA, XSTREME, MEME-ChIP: Increased width of some help bubbles for ease of reading.</li>
            <li>docker_test and docker_test_driver: added these new scripts to <code>tests/scripts</code> directory
		to allow testing of final Docker images.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>STREME:
	       <ul>
		 <li>Fixed problem that caused the Sites column in the HTML output to sometimes be incorrect.  
		   The total number of sites was (incorrectly) including negative (control) sequences matching the motif.  
		   Now, the total is only the number of positive sequences matching the motif, as was documented.</li>
		 <li>Fixed a problem when the input size was greater than specified by <code>--totallength</code>.
		   This problem caused the Matching Sites file (<code>sites.tsv</code>) to contain sites coming from
		   a different subsample of the input sequences than used during motif discovery.</li>
	       </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>STREME and SEA: Fixed broken links to FASTA Coordinates Format document in help bubbles in HTML outputs.</li>
	    <li>XSTREME: Removed empty <code>sites.tsv</code> and <code>sequences.tsv</code> files from output.</li>
	    <li>fasta-holdout-set: Fixed bug causing output sequences to be blank.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

* [August 24, 2023] Release 5.5.4 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
            <li>FIMO:
	      <ul>
	        <li>A new output file is now created containing the "best" (i.e, highest log-odds score) site for each motif 
		in each sequence.  This file is in ENCODE narrowPeak format.  The new file contains, for each
		site, its genomic location and its log-odds score, as well as other information such as its strand 
		and <i>p</i>-value.  Only sites passing the significance threshold you specify are output.  
		This file is intended to be suitable as input to T-Gene and other programs.
	      </ul>
            </li>
            <li>SpaMo:
	      <ul>
	        <li>Added a new option <code>-norc</code> to allow DNA sequences to be treated
		as though they were RNA.  That is, only the given strand of the sequences will
		be scanned with the primary and secondary motifs.  Without this option, both
		strands of DNA sequences will be scanned for motif sites.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>CREATE-PRIORS, FASTA-CENTER, FIMO, MCAST, MEME-ChIP, STREME, XSTREME:
	      <ul>
	        <li>Removed <code>--parse-genomic-coord</code> switch and added <code>--no-pgc</code> switch.  Now, by default,
		FASTA sequence headers are <b>always</b> parsed for genomic coordinates unless the <code>--no-pgc</code>
                option is specified.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>T-GENE:
              <ul>
	        <li>Changed how the Correlation <i>p</i>-value is computed.  The null
		  scores (correlations) are now generated using a different method of randomizing
		  the input data.  Previously, the order of the tissues for just the expression was 
		  permuted when computing a null correlation for a link.  
		  This caused problems with excessively low <i>p</i>-values being reported
		  if some of the tissues had very similar expression values for many (or all) genes.
		  Now, a null correlation for a link is computed by replacing the links expression
		  values with the expression values for a different link.  This change generally results in
		  a small change in the Correlation <i>p</i>-values, except when one or more tissues
		  have very similar expression values for many (or all) genes.</li>
		<li>Added the ability to sort the results on the <i>q</i>-values of links.</li>
		<li>Added check that the tissue list contains at least three tissues. There is nothing
		    to be gained using only two tissues because all of the expression-histone correlations
		    will, by definition, be equal to +1 or -1.</li>
		<li>Clarified the coordinate systems for TSS Locus and RE Locus columns in the HTML output.</li>
	      </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>update-sequence-db:
              <ul>
                <li>In addition to its previous use for downloading all the FASTA sequence files
		 for a selected category of database (e.g., Ensembl Vertebrates),
		 this program can now be used to list which FASTA sequence files are missing from the category.
		 This is the new default output.
		 The program can also be used to download a single FASTA file (or group of FASTA files) 
		 that is/are missing from the category.  This behaviour is controlled by new options
		 <code>--db_all</code> and <code>--db_regexp</code>. Another new feature is the ability to list
		 the available releases for a particular category (supported only for Ensembl currently).
		 New option <code>--list_rel</code> causes this output.
		 In conjunction with the ability to list releases, you can now specify a specific release
		 and only missing FASTA sequence files for that release will be listed or downloaded.
		 This uses new option <code>--db_rel</code>.</li>
                <li>Removed --epd switch. The EPD is now handled using the <code>--misc</code> option
	         and the <code>conf/db_general.csv</code> file.</li>
                <li>Downloaded Ensembl genomes are now the "soft-masked" versions whenever these
	         are available, otherwise the un-masked versions are downloaded.  The UCSC genomes
		 are already always the soft-masked versions.  GenBank genomes are not masked.</li>
                <li>Fixed FTP address in properties file for UCSC databases (it had changed at UCSC).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Usage Statistics: added new choice to "Authors & Citing" menu
		that provides information about past usage of the main
		MEME Suite production server.</li>
            <li>index-sequence-db: The utility program "fasta-indexer" was renamed to "index-sequence-db".</li>
            <li>index-fasta-file: The utility program "index-fasta-file" was renamed to "fasta-file-indexer".</li>
	    <li>Webservers for MAST, MCAST, Glam2Scan: make "Upload File" the default for sequences because
		the old default ("Databases Select Category") slowed down loading the page due to the presence of 35,000
		Ensembl bacterial genomes at the top of the list of databases.</li>
	  </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Documentation</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>AME: 
              <ul>
	 	<li>Fixed mismatch between the sample output for AME and the input files
		used to generate it shown at the top-right of the AME web server input page.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>T-GENE: 
              <ul>
	 	<li>Fixed table describing GTF fields under <code>--rna-source</code> option.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>SpaMo: 
              <ul>
	 	<li>Added missing documentation for option <code>-usebestsec</code>.</li>
	 	<li>Fixed documentation of <code>-dumpseqs</code> and <code>dumpsigs</code> options.</li>
	        <li>Added documentation for new option <code>-norc</code>.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>index-sequence-db: Added missing manual page.</li>
            <li>fasta-file-indexer: Added missing manual page.</li>
            <li>Sequence Databases: Added note to Sequence Databases page about
		contacting us with requests to add a database or database release to the
		MEME Suite web server.</li>

                 <li>Fixed computation of correlation coefficient. Previously was sometimes 
		   giving correlations above +1 or below -1 due to rounding errors. This was
		   resulting in anomolously low correlation <i>p</i>-values. All correlations
		   are now rounded to 6 significant digits. Note: This also affects AME results very slightly
		   when using the Pearson method.</li>
                 <li>Fixed computation of correlation <i>p</i>-value when many correlations have the same magnitude. 
		   Was giving very low <i>p</i>-values when many correlations have the same magnitude.</li>
		 <li>Fixed the documentation bubble for the correlation in the HTML output.</li>
		 <li>Added check so that the permutations used for computing the Correlation <i>p</i>-value 
		   are all non-identity permutations.</li>
                 <li>Renamed "Number of Permutations" to "Maximum Number of Permutations" in HTML output.</li>
               </ul>
	     <li>CREATE-PRIORS: Fixed bug that caused it to crash when parsing genomic coordinates.</li>
	     <li>update-sequence-db:
               <ul>
                 <li>Fixed problem with incorrect description fields in Ensembl databases.</li>
                 <li>Fixed problem with incorrect description fields in Other Genomes and Other Databases.</li>
                 <li>Fixed problem with Ensembl FTP address:  <code>ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/ensemblgenomes/pub</code>
		   does not have recent releases. Now using ftp addresses: <code>ftp.ensembl.org/pub</code>
		   for vertebrates and <code>ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub</code> for all other organisms.</li>

* [June 15, 2023] Release 5.5.3 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
            <li>MCAST:
              <ul>
                <li>Removed the -synth switch and changed the way that MCAST estimates
		the statistical significance of matches. The estimates are now always based on 
		randomly generated sequences with GC-contents spanning that of the discovered motif
		clusters and their flanking regions.  This makes MCAST's estimation of the
		statistical significance of matches much more robust and reliable.
		This enhancement causes the reported <i>p</i>-values to differ 
		somewhat from previous versions of the MEME Suite, which estimated
		significance solely using all the observed matches in the input sequences.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>STREME
              <ul>
                <li>STREME now creates a single file ('sites.tsv') in TSV format that contains
                    the positions of the sites of each discovered motif.  These are the same
                    sites that STREME used to generate the PWM for the corresponding motif.</li>
                <li>Added -parse-genomic-coord option, which causes STREME 
		    if possible to show actual genomic coordinates of discovered motif sites
		    in the new 'sites.tsv' output.</li>
                <li>Fixed rounding problems so that the lowest scoring sites are correctly
		    included in the motif PWM and in the TSV lists of sequences and sites.
		    This will affect the results on some inputs compared with previous
		    releases.  This also can affect XSTREME and MEME-ChIP results since 
		    they include STREME results.  It also affects SEA results slightly.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>STREME and SEA:
              <ul>
                <li>Improved how the control sequences are trimmed in order to allow the more
		    accurate Fisher Test to be used with more datasets.</li>
                <li>Improved reliability by only using the Fisher Test if both the hold-out
		    and non-hold-out sequence sets meet the average length criterion.
		    (Primary and Control sequence sets must have the same average length;
		    Control sequences will be trimmed if their average length is greater.)</li>
	 	<li>Added --notrim switch to suppress trimming of Control sequences if desired.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MEME-ChIP:
              <ul>
                <li>Added -parse-genomic-coord option, which causes MEME-ChIP 
		if possible to show actual genomic coordinates of discovered motif sites
                in the STREME sites TSV output and FIMO output.</li>
		<li>Added -streme-align opton to allow the STREME site positional
		distribution diagrams to align the sequences on their left, center or
		right ends.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>XSTREME:
              <ul>
                <li>Added -parse-genomic-coord option, which causes XSTREME
		if possible to show actual genomic coordinates of discovered motif sites
                in the STREME sites TSV output and FIMO output.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MEME:
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed command line that is printed in the results files when MEME is run with
		the -p <np> option.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>fasta-center:
              <ul>
                <li>Added -parse-genomic-coord option, which causes fasta-center
		to put the correct genomic coordinates of the centered
		sequences it outputs in their FASTA headers, if possible.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Web Servers:
              <ul>

              </li>
	      <li>BED2FASTA webserver:</li>
                <ul>
		  <li>The "Input the sequences" menu is now empty if there are no 
		  installed databases (since they are required by BED2FASTA).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Documentation</b>
	  <ul>

* [April 9, 2023] Release 5.5.2 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Docker: Added parallel mode to MEME (-p N switch), resulting in
		N-times speedup for MEME, and speedup of MEME-ChIP and XSTREME.
                On a typical Mac with the M1 ChIP, MEME 5.5.2 running via 
		the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/memesuite/memesuite">Docker image</a> is now 
		at least <b>40 times faster</b> than version 5.5.0.
	    </li>	
	    <li>MEME: The input files for the MEME example command lines
		can now be downloaded by clicking on them in the MEME command documentation. 
		This is useful when MEME has not been installed from source (e.g., was
		installed using MacPorts or via a Docker image).</li>
            <li>Side-bar Menu: The menu now shows the number of jobs running and pending
		on the MEME Suite webserver.  This allows users to see how many jobs
		will be ahead of their newly-submitted job.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>Tomtom: fixed problem parsing motif files when the number of sites of a motif was very large.</li>
	    <li>MEME: fixed warning with MPICH due to not freeing declared MPI datatypes.</li>
	    <li>MEME: fixed crash when running in parallel mode due to nodes all having the same score in reduction.</li>
	    <li>STREME: fixed problem generating HTML when the input has very long sequences.</li>
	    <li>README file: updated with SEA, STREME, XSTREME tools.</li>

	    <li>AME: round PWM scores to 10 digits and print "U" differently so
		results will be consistent across platforms (including Docker and Ubuntu).</li>
          </ul>
       </ul>

<p><hr></p>
* [October 2022] Release 5.5.0 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>bed2fasta: (NEW) Extracts sequence regions specified in a BED file
		from a FASTA genome file. You can use this utility can be used via the
		MEME Suite web-server to create FASTA files from BED files
		(such as output by ChIP-seq peak callers).  It can also
		be used as a stand-alone utility.
            </li>
	    <li>BED file input for MEME Suite web tools: (NEW) The MEME Suite web tools
		that allow you to upload a FASTA file now also permit you to upload a BED file
		and to select the corresponding (supported) genome instead.
		This makes it unnecessary for the you to create the FASTA file yourself.
	    </li>
	    <li>update-sequence-db: (Improved user interface)
	      You can now download and install DNA and protein sequence databases for
	      your local MEME SUITE web server with more flexibility.  Each
	      of the divisions of the Ensembl, Genbank, UCSC and Upstream
	      databases can be selected separately. This allows you to just
	      download the genomes for bacteria if you do not need metazoan
	      genomes, for example.  You can also download individual sequence databases
              via FTP or HTTP using the --misc switch.  (Previously, only FTP accessible
	      databases were supported.)  update-sequence-db automatically runs
	      fasta-indexer.  Update-sequence-db no longer updates all the sequence
	      databases by default; you must specify one or more divisions to update.
            </li>
            <li>Unicode UTF-8 Characters:
              FASTA sequence identifiers and <b>Minimal MEME Motif Format</b> motif names 
              may now contain UTF-8 characters (e.g., Japanese and Chinese characters).  
              These should display correctly in HTML and TXT output files from the MEME Suite
	      tools. When displaying TSV output files using Excel, you must import 
              the TSV file using "Data/From text" and then choose "File origin:" "UTF-8".
              Acceptance of UTF-8 characters is now supported by AME, CentriMo, FIMO, MAST, MCAST,
	      MEME, MEME-ChIP, SEA, STREME, Tomtom and XSTREME.  All the FASTA sequence utilities
              described in the <a href="https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/overview.html?man_type=web#fasta">MEME Suite Overview</a>
              also support UTF-characters in the FASTA sequence identifiers in their input.
              The utilities meme-get-motif, meme-rename and motif-shuffle columns also
	      support UTF-8 in the motif identifiers in their <b>Minimal MEME Motif Format</b> input.
            </li>
	    <li>prosite2meme: (NEW) convert PROSITE patterns to MEME motif format.
            </li>
	    <li>fasta-indexer: (NEW) Creates index files for the genomes in the sequence database directory.
		This functionality is required by bed2fasta, and depends on a you first creating
		a MEME Suite database using the update-sequence-databases utility.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>STREME: fixed bug in printing of site_distr in XML file
	      when motif width equals maximum sequence length.</li>
	    <li>Custom alphabets: Fixed bug in reading of MEME text files
	      so that the alphabet section can contain comment lines and trailing comments,
	      as permitted in alphabet files.</li>
	    <li>MoMo: Fixed bug with short FASTA database sequences causing crash.
            <li>Unicode Characters: repaired a bug that caused Unicode characters (such
	      as Chinese characters) in motif names and sequence names to cause MEME Suite
	      programs to crash.</li>
	    <li>MEME: 
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed bug when the motif width is the maximum value (-w 300 or -maxw 300) that
		  caused crashing.</li>
                <li>Fixed bug with position-specific priors caused by an error in the
		  DELOG(x) function that caused it to return negative values.</li>
                <li>Fixed bug with position-specific priors caused by an off-by-1 error in the
		  psp_renormalize function.</li>
                <li>Fixed bug with ANR mode caused by setting nsites_dis larger than n_maxima
		  in the discretization function.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>FIMO: fixed bug when FASTA sequence IDs are very long that caused crashing of FIMO.</li>
            <li>getsize: fixed hash-table bug when FASTA sequence IDs are very long that caused crashing of getsize.</li>
            <li>GLAM2:
              <ul>
                <li>Fixed bug caused by motif counts reaching 0 by adding an epsilon.</li>
		<li>glam2html: fixed bugs in Python 3 version of this utility.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>AMA: fixed bug due to motifs wider than 300.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

* [August 2021] Release 5.4.0 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>XSTREME: Combined motif discovery and enrichment analysis.
		Combines the results of ab initio discovery using MEME and STREME
		with motif enrichment analysis using SEA.  Groups similar
		ab initio motifs with each other and with known motifs.
		XSTREME is similar to MEME-CHIP, but is more appropriate when the motifs
		may not tend to be enriched in the centers of the input sequences, and
		works well with protein sequences and nucleotide sequences.
	    </li>	
            <li>SEA: Simple Enrichment Analysis of motifs. Reports known motifs that are
		enriched in your sequences relative to your control sequences or to
		shuffled versions of your sequences.  Replaces and enhances ENR.
	    </li>	
	    <li>STREME: 
              <ul>
		<li>Added options --thresh and --evalue to allow STREME to stop
		  looking for motifs based on their <i>E</i>-values rather than their
		  <i>p</i>-values.  (The --thresh option replaces the --pvt option,
		  which is still available for backward compatability.)
                </i>
                <li>Added motif <i>E</i>-value column in HTML output and change MEME format
		  motif header to E= in streme.txt.
		</li>
                <li>Added "Positional Distribution" plots to HTML output.
		  These plots show how the sites of each motif are distributed
		  within the input sequences.  Alignment of sequences for the
		  plots is controlled by the new --align option.
	        </li>	
		<li>Added output of a file (sequences.tsv) containing the names of each
		    input sequence that contains a site of a discovered motif.
		</li>	
                <li>Added "Matches per Sequence" plots to HTML output.
		  These plots show the distribution of the percentage of sequences
		  with different numbers of matches to each significant motif.
	        </li>	
		<li>The Sites column in the HTML now shows both the number of
		  percentage of positive sequences with a site as well as the number of sequences.
		</li>	
		<li>The meme.txt file of motifs created by STREME now shows
		    the Score (Training Set <i>p</i>-value) rather than the Test Set <i>p</i>-value
		    when there was no Test Set due to the input containing too few sequences.
		    This is indicated in the motif "letter-probability matrix" line, where "P=" is 
		    now replaced by "S=".
		</li>	
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MEME: Will now search for up to 1000 motifs if -evt is given

            <li>AME: 
              <ul>
                <li>Added the motif alternate ID to the sequence.tsv output.  The

              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>fasta-holdout-set: New utility for splitting primary (positive) and control
		(negative) sequence sets into a main and holdout sets.  Input is
		one or two FASTA sequence files.  Output is two or four FASTA sequence
		files.  If no control sequences are given, they are created by shuffling
		the primary sequences.  By default, each FASTA file (primary and control) 
		is split into two FASTA files containing 90% ("main file") 
		and 10% (holdout file) of the input sequences, respectively.  If either of the
		holdout files (primary or control) would contain fewer than 10 sequences, 
		no holdout files are created and all sequences are put in the main files.
		This utility was create for use by XSTREME.
            </li>
            <li>configure.ac: Added --with-mpi-nprocs to allow MPI jobs (e.g., meme) to
		use multiple processors when run as web services.
            </li>
            <li>Consolidated all citations in doc/js/citation.js to remove redundancy
		and to prevent things from getting out of sync.
            </li>
	    <li>Added check for multiple cores to speed up "make test".  Adds dependency
		on perl module "Sys::Info".
 	    </li>
	    <li>Simplified Tomtom web-server implementation.  Removed the "run-immediate"
		option; all Tomtom jobs now go through the "short queue".

      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
	  <ul>
	    <li>MEME-CHIP web server: Modified Tomtom to send short jobs to a short job queue, 
              rather executing them directly</li>
	    <li>Changed the time outputs from CPU time to ELAPSED time in MEME, STREME, MAST and TOMTOM so that the "-time"
	      option works even when the job gets less than 100% of CPU time.</li>
	    <li>Added configure switches for setting the maximum memory and run time of jobs
	      submitted via the web.</li>
	    <li>Added --totallength = maximum memory / 1000 to input to STREME when
	      submitted via the web.  Same for STREME called from MEME-ChIP submitted via the web.
	      This will prevent STREME from using too much memory.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>

* [November 2020] Release 5.3.0 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>MEME-CHIP: 
              <ul>
                <li>STREME now replaces DREME in the MEME-CHIP pipeline.
		<li>The maximum allowed motif width is reduced to 30 (from 300).
		<li>The motif width search range now defaults to [6,15] (from [6,30]).
		<li>The motif width options are now -minw and -maxw (were -meme-minw and -meme-maxw),
		and the minimum and maximum widths apply to motifs found by both MEME and STREME.
		<li>The default for the Markov model order option (-order) is raised from 1 to 2.
		<li>The Markov model is now created from the control sequences if given, not the primary sequences.
		<li>The -norc option is replaced by the -dna2rna option, which causes 
		STREME and MEME to output RNA motifs given DNA sequence.  CentriMo and SpaMo will display
		the DNA sequences as RNA; FIMO shows the sequences as DNA even when the motifs are RNA.
		<li>SpaMo and FIMO are now only run on motifs discovered by MEME and STREME (not on motifs
		from the motif database(s), which saves lots of time.  
		The user can perform a separate SpaMo analysis using any motif later, if desired.
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>MEME-CHIP web server: 
              <ul>
                <li>The default background model order is now 2nd order (was 1st order).
		<li>The width range option is now under Universal options (was under MEME options).
		<li>The Universal option "Scan both DNA strands" has been removed, and now a checkbox
		appears when you input DNA sequences: "Convert DNA sequences to RNA?".
		<li>You may now specify that MEME find 0 motifs, and STREME find 0 motifs,
		so only CentriMo will run, followed by a clustering of enriched motifs.
              </ul>
            </li>
	    <li>STREME: Added the "Sites" column to the HTML output to make it more like MEME output.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Bug Fixes</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>STREME: fixed bugs in links to TEXT and XML outputs in the template HTML output.
	    <li>STREME: fixed rare bug when palindrome went past end of seed.
	    <li>STREME: fixed globals in header that were not declared extern.
	    <li>ENR: fixed typo in documentation.
	    <li>MEME-CHIP webserver: fixed bug where the the control sequence disappeared after page refresh.
	    <li>General: Added charset=UTF-8 to etc/job_status.tmpl to stop Firefox console warnings.
	    <li>General: Fixed duplicate variable declarations that caused compile failure with GCC v10.
	    <li>General: Added -fno-common to CFLAGS so that variables not declared
		"extern" in .h files will cause an error with MacOS compilers, as
		the do with GCC v10.
	    <li>General: Fixed bug in SameSite attribute of Google Analytics cookies.

* [October 2020] Release 5.2.0 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>STREME: The new <a href="streme.html">STREME</a> motif discovery algorithm is designed to replace DREME 
		and to complement MEME.  STREME finds more accurate motifs than DREME, finds
		more subtle motifs, can find much wider motifs (up to 30 wide vs. 8 wide), 
		and can quickly process very large sequence datasets 
		(e.g., 4,000,000bp DNA input in 100 seconds/motif).
		STREME provides <b>accurate estimates</b> of the statistical significance
		of the motifs it discovers.
		Like MEME, STREME works with a wide range of sequence alphabets: DNA, RNA,
		protein and custom (user-specified) alphabets.  Like DREME, STREME can
		work with a single input set of sequences, or you can provide a set
		of control sequences for discriminative motif discovery.
		<br>
		STREME is available both via its webserver and as a command-line program
		if you download the MEME Suite software.
	    <li>ENR: The new <a href="enr.html">ENR</a> (Motif ENRichment Analysis) algorithm applies the same objective 
                function used by the STREME motif discovery algorithm to measure the enrichment 
                of motifs large sequence datasets. It is useful for comparing the discriminative 
		power of motifs found by STREME and other motif discovery tools.
		The input to ENR is one or two sets of sequences. 
                The control sequences should have approximately the same length distribution as the 
                primary sequences. If you do not provide a control set, the program shuffles the 
                primary set to create a control set. The program uses Fisher's Exact Test to 
                determine significance of each motif found in the positive set as compared 
                with its representation in the control set, using a significance threshold 
                that may be set on the command line.
	    <li>fasta-grep: Now -erase now works with proteins (as well as DNA) replacing 
		matching words with 'X's.</li>
	    <li>fasta-shuffle-letters: New option -fix allows shuffling
		while preserving the position of a selected character.
		This is useful to allow 0-order (-kmer 1) shuffling of masked sequences
		while preserving runs of the masked character.</li>
            <li>MEME motif text format: Now allows "P= &lt;motif p-value&gt;" in place of
		"E= &lt;motif p-value&gt;" on the letter-probability matrix line.

            <li>CentriMo webserver: fixed the Advanced option "Choose the match score threshold; optimize score" button.
	    <li>MAST: fixed -mev so that it works.  Also works when the motif file

        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>The MEME Suite build will now detect whether the version
		of Python being used is version 2 or version 3, and generate
		the appropriate version of tools such as Dreme.</li>
	    <li> Tomtom: Added limit on the query width to prevent
		memory overrun.  TOMTOM_MAX_QUERY_WIDTH is set to 100 by
		default but can be changed by installer via src/user.h.
		Also, added a <code>-time</code> option to limit the CPU
		time used by a Tomtom job.
            </li>
            <li>Tomtom webserver: Set limit (default 3) on number of
		concurrent "run immediately" Tomtom jobs that can run, and limit
		such jobs to 1 minute of CPU time.
		This prevents exceeding the server's memory.

* [October 2019] Release 5.1.0 MEME Suite
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Features and Enhancements</b>
          <ul>
	    <li>CisMapper: removed from the MEME-Suite; has been replaced by <b>T-Gene</b>.
            </li>
	    <li>T-Gene: New command line program for improved prediction of the gene targets of transcription factors
                from BED files containing the genomic locations of possible regulatory elements (typically,
		a bed file of ChIP-seq peaks).  T-Gene's only other required input is a gene annotation file,
		and computes a statistical, distance-based score for each potential regulatory link
		between a locus in the BED file and a transcription start site (TSS) of a transcript in the annotation file. 
		T-Gene can also use a Tissue Panel containing histone modification data and gene expression
		data for a set of tissue or cell types.  It then computes a statistical score for each
		link that combines distance with the correlation in histone state at the locus and expression
		of the gene, achieving higher accuracy than methods based only on distance or correlation.
		T-Gene also includes a link to the <b>closest</b> TSS to each locus (putative
		regulatory element) element, and such links have much higher predictive accuracy in 
		empirical studies.  T-Gene computes <i>p</i>-values for the observed expression/histone correlation by
		generating a null model based on shuffling the order of the expression tissues
		relative to the histone tissues.  T-Gene computes the <i>p</i> value for the
		distance between an RE and a TSS assuming a uniform distribution on the distance:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt><i>p</i>-value = (distance + RE width) / (maximum distance + RE width)</tt>.<br>
		T-Gene computes a score that combines Correlation and Distance (<b>CnD <i>p</i>-value</b>)
		by computing the <i>p</i>-value of the product of the correlation and distance <i>p</i>-values.
		Finally, T-Gene computes the Q-value of the CND <i>p</i>-value, which is defined as the
		minimum false discovery rate (FDR) required to consider this link statistically significant.
		All regulatory links predicted by T-Gene are labeled as to whether they are either
		"closest-TSS" or "closest-locus" links.
	    </li>
	    <li>T-Gene Web Server: added, featuring tissue panels for Human and Mouse and Genomes
		for 8 model organisms: Arabidopsis, Worm, Zebrafish, Fly, Human, Mouse, Rat, and Yeast.
            </li>
            <li>The MEME HTML output now allows you to generate an image of the 
                <b>motif location diagram</b> as either 1) a PDF image file suitable for use in publications, 
		or, 2) an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image file suitable for inclusion in HTML documents.
            </li>
            <li>CentriMo now lists the number of reported regions in the control sequences
                containing the best match to a motif, and the number of motif matches in the control scoring 
	        higher than the score threshold.

		from transcription factor ChIP-seq peaks, provided as a BED file.
		CisMapper can be run from its new webserver page, or from the
		command line.  
		CisMapper uses gene expression and histone modification
